#  Default Browser

Default Browser replaces macOS's system web browser setting with a flexible, convenient utility that opens links with your most recently used browser.

https://defaultbrowser.app

## Features

- **Intelligent link handling** Opens external links with your last used browser.
- **Quick browser toggle** Keyboard shortcuts from the menu bar.
- **Menu bar preview** Quick reference of the currently active browser.
- **Blocklist** Prevent browsers from automatically opening.
- **Legacy behavior** Select your primary browser to simulate traditional behavior.
- **Shortcuts support** Force a specific browser with Siri Shortcuts

## Notes

- No longer can automatically register as `html` file handler. At some point in the past, Apple restricted the ability of apps to register as the default opener for the UTType `public.html` (https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/issues/2205#issuecomment-541972453).
